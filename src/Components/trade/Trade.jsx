              Consolidation is not right for everyone, so you should carefully
              consider your options. Before deciding whether to retain assets in
              a retirement plan account through a former employer, roll them
              over to a qualified retirement plan account through a new employer
              (if one is available and rollovers are permitted), or roll them
              over to an IRA, an investor should consider all his or her options
              and the various factors including, but not limited to, the
              differences in investment options, fees and expenses, services,
              the exceptions to the early withdrawal penalties, protection from
              creditors and legal judgments, required minimum distributions, the
              tax treatment of employer stock (if held in the qualified
              retirement plan account), and the availability of plan loans
              (i.e., loans are not permitted from IRAs, and the availability of
              loans from a qualified retirement plan will depend on the terms of
              the plan). For additional information, view the{" "}

              Prior to investing in a managed portfolio, E*TRADE Capital
              Management will obtain important information about your financial
              situation and risk tolerances and provide you with a detailed
              investment proposal, investment advisory agreement, and wrap fee
              programs brochure. These documents contain important information
              that should be read carefully before enrolling in a managed
              account program. Please read the{" "}

              and options trades. Exclusions may apply and E*TRADE reserves the
              right to charge variable commission rates. The standard options
              contract fee is $0.65 per contract (or $0.50 per contract for
              customers who execute at least 30 stock, ETF, and options trades
              per quarter). The retail online $0 commission does not apply to

              transactions requiring special handling, transaction-fee mutual
              funds, futures, or fixed income investments. Service charges apply

              transactions are subject to a separate commission schedule.
              Additional regulatory and exchange fees may apply. For more

              business days following the expiration of the 60 day period.
              However, if you deposit $200,000 or more, you will receive a cash

              a higher tier, you will receive a second cash credit following the
              close of the 60 day window. For example, if you deposit $250,000,
              you will receive a cash credit of $600 within seven business days,
              then if you deposit an additional $300,000 into your new account,
              you will receive an additional cash credit of $600 at the end of
              the 60 day window for a total reward of $1,200. If you deposit
              between $200,000 and $1,499,999 in your new account, you will
              receive a cash credit in two transactions at the end of the 60 day
              window—depending on your initial funding amount. If you deposit
              $1,500,000 or more in your new account, you will receive two cash
              credits that will total $3,500 within seven business days. Cash
              credits will be paid to the account where the deposit is made.

              on the business day the deposit is received as reflected in
              transaction history. Removing any deposit or cash during the
              promotion period (60 days) may result in lower reward amount or
              loss of reward. Any assets transferred from Morgan Stanley
              accounts to E*TRADE are not considered to be from accounts outside
              of E*TRADE and may not be included for purposes of offer
              eligibility or reward amount calculations, at E*TRADE’s sole
              discretion.

                Consolidation is not right for everyone, so you should carefully
                consider your options. Before deciding whether to retain assets
                in a retirement plan account through a former employer, roll
                them over to a qualified retirement plan account through a new
                employer (if one is available and rollovers are permitted), or
                roll them over to an IRA, an investor should consider all his or
                her options and the various factors including, but not limited
                to, the differences in investment options, fees and expenses,
                services, the exceptions to the early withdrawal penalties,
                protection from creditors and legal judgments, required minimum
                distributions, the tax treatment of employer stock (if held in
                the qualified retirement plan account), and the availability of
                plan loans (i.e., loans are not permitted from IRAs, and the
                availability of loans from a qualified retirement plan will
                depend on the terms of the plan). For additional information,

                If you have multiple IRAs at E*TRADE or at other financial
